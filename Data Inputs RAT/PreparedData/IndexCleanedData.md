DRAFT

## Phase 2

## Phase 1
There were four main types of Platform Data prepared per batch of textual data analysed (see archives for files): 
#### claim_metadata
This provided the list of unique claims, with associated informtion: 
category (~discipline); group (who assessed the claim); workshop (when & where the claim was assesed)/   
#### justification_comments
This where the textual-data from the platfrom is provided - each row included a unit of textual data 
(either a justification or a comment, although note sometimes these are listed in the same row), 
along with associated information (participant, group, etc.,) 
#### ratings_by_claim
#### demographics
