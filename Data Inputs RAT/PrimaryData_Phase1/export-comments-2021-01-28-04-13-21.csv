I agree and I think the authors have also conducted qualitative assessment to compensate for the lack of quantitative manipulation check. Sorry for being vague, by large effect I mean --> ""it must have been *grossly* overestimated."" I feel unqualified to answer your question, I think these two resources could give a better explanation : (1) this short post from Sanjay --> https://thehardestscience.com/2013/09/09/the-flawed-logic-of-chasing-large-effects-with-small-samples/ & (2) this paper from Lakens --> https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00863/full",1,1,2020.05.15.09.40.06

My bad for being vague. In my head it goes like this: (1) Small sample --> large variance --> larger ES;  (2) significant p-value + small sample size --> larger ES (caused by large variance). When I say ""large ES"", I was trying to point out that the observed effect may have been overestimated due to large variance between group (I know the authors have tried to compensate for this by holding the pre-exam score as covariate). Since the phenomena being studied by social scientist is complex --> true large effect size must be rare. Therefore, when we come across large effect size, it is more likely a result of chances rather than true effect. Hence my belief that the result could be false positive. Not a perfect reasoning, I reckon but this questionnable heuristics has guided my decision so far. In the end, I must say, my whole repliCATS process is mostly a gut thing.  =\",0,0,2020.05.15.09.40.06

I agree that it's not good there's no exact p-value (or CIs around the regression coefficients, for that matter.) Just curious: how does one qualify an effect size as small, medium or large when you have standardized regression coefficients in a multiple regression? I was struggling with this a bit, but it seemed to me that the effect size for the interaction is rather large compared to the main effects for the interaction terms (hence the interaction erases the effect of mother-child MRO on self-regulation for children not prone to negative emotionality.)

However, I also think that there is inter-individual variability in help seeking. I personally know people who have very high expectancy for success, but still not seek help from teachers and peers, because of some other reasons. Maybe they are shy to ask, or not very comfortable with it. The researchers included  some cognitive and motivational  correlates, but I thought they are missing some others. I might be wrong.

You say communities may want to vote a candidate out, and I agree, and I think the authors of the paper agree too. They say that the desire to vote AGAINST an incumbent is one of the reasons they expect higher turnout when an incumbent is on the ballot.
By the way, if you are so skeptical, how do you justify your upper bound of 90% chance of replicating and your middle point as 50% chance? If you thought this claim was implausible, why do you think there is a good chance of it replicating?",0,0,2020.05.14.14.13.09

For direct replication of the specific claim, though, I don't think the sample size of the midterm exam, the presence of a confound, or participant knowledge of differences are relevant. If I understand correctly, we're meant to evaluate the probability of successful replication assuming the direct replications are carried out in the same way in new groups of participants and that the test of replication success would focus on transfer test performance alone.  In that case,  it makes great sense to reduce the estimated probability of replication success based on poor reliability of the transfer test and small size of the sample for the key test. Presumably, the confound present in the original research would be present in the replication research as would participant knowledge of differences in delivery format; thus these seem less relevant to judging replication success - they'll be constants. And the sample size of the midterm exam isn't relevant because it's not the focus of the claim.  (Editing to add: But maybe all of these factors generally lead you to believe the research is low in quality, and this reduces the estimated probability of successful replication of the specific claim?

Is this because you don't fully understand the effect size? I don't think full understanding of the effect size is necessary to be confident that, if tested again, performance on arithmetic will be positively correlated with performance on pre-algebra problems (p < 0.05 - the standard for repliCATS).

That said, this analysis seems to be a generalized liner mixed model where the response variable is binomial (correct vs. incorrect), and the coefficients are positive if higher values for the continuous predictor (higher #s of addition problems correct) are associated with greater likelihood of a correct answer for a pre-algebra problem.",0,0,2020.05.14.01.05.20

The first hit for 'charter school meta analysis' was Betts and Tang 2016, and their abstract says ""A meta-analysis was performed of the literature on charter schools and achievement, with a focus on lottery-based studies and rigorous value-added studies. Overall, for the limited set of charter schools, locations, and years that have been studied to date, charter schools are producing higher achievement gains in math relative to traditional public schools in most grade groupings. No significant differences emerged for reading achievement. However, for both math and reading the bulk of estimates are positive. Estimated charter school effects are highly variable, which likely reflects variations in the quality of education provided both at charter schools and at comparison schools, namely, local traditional public schools.""

Thus - variability, but higher math scores on average is a reasonable prior.

By the way, 0% probability of replication doesn't make sense given that they will be using a 'significance' threshold of 0.05 - so type I error should emerge 5% of the time. ",1,1,2020.05.14.14.35.54
