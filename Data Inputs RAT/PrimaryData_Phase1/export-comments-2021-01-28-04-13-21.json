In my head it goes like this: (1) Small sample --> large variance --> larger ES;  (2) significant p-value + small sample size --> larger ES (caused by large variance). When I say \"large ES\", I was trying to point out that the observed effect may have been overestimated due to large variance between group (I know the authors have tried to compensate for this by holding the pre-exam score as covariate). Since the phenomena being studied by social scientist is complex --> true large effect size must be rare. Therefore, when we come across large effect size, it is more likely a result of chances rather than true effect. Hence my belief that the result could be false positive. Not a perfect reasoning, I reckon but this questionnable heuristics has guided my decision so far. In the end, I must say, my whole repliCATS process is mostly a gut thing.  =\\",

For direct replication of the specific claim, though, I don't think the sample size of the midterm exam, the presence of a confound, or participant knowledge of differences are relevant. If I understand correctly, we're meant to evaluate the probability of successful replication assuming the direct replications are carried out in the same way in new groups of participants and that the test of replication success would focus on transfer test performance alone.  In that case,  it makes great sense to reduce the estimated probability of replication success based on poor reliability of the transfer test and small size of the sample for the key test. Presumably, the confound present in the original research would be present in the replication research as would participant knowledge of differences in delivery format; thus these seem less relevant to judging replication success - they'll be constants. And the sample size of the midterm exam isn't relevant because it's not the focus of the claim.  (Editing to add: But maybe all of these factors generally lead you to believe the research is low in quality, and this reduces the estimated probability of successful replication of the specific claim? That makes sense to me!)",

Thus some effects will appear much larger and some much smaller than the true underlying effect. The bias only comes in if  reporting is contingent on outcome and so inflated estimates are shared more often. Clearly this often happens, but it will be a much smaller problem when the underlying effect is strong and reliable. Thus its worth asking what sort of effect you would expect from the given study. In this case, I expect a strong and reliable effect.  After all, the intuitive nature of this result makes it almost trivial. Wouldn't you be surprised if comparing magnitude of fractions with common denominators was NOT faster than comparing magnitude of fractions without common denominators? ",

But I still think that the statistical validity of the claim is shaky and replicability is rather unlikely. (If the claim had focused on school anxiety, I would have had a more optimistic take on replicability.)",

That's a separate study about the migrant experience. I do think Brexit and the effects of the refugee crisis that hit countries in 2015-2016 would definitely make replication interesting. This study was also conducted well before Brexit (it uses data from 13 years earlier) so I fail to see how Brexit's referendum refutes this study.",

Is this because you don't fully understand the effect size? I don't think full understanding of the effect size is necessary to be confident that, if tested again, performance on arithmetic will be positively correlated with performance on pre-algebra problems (p < 0.05 - the standard for repliCATS). \n\nThat said, this analysis seems to be a generalized liner mixed model where the response variable is binomial (correct vs. incorrect), and the coefficients are positive if higher values for the continuous predictor (higher #s of addition problems correct) are associated with greater likelihood of a correct answer for a pre-algebra problem.",

Here the claim only looks at number of sex partners & it's relationship with music achievement. I think that other variables play a way bigger role in number of sex partners (preference for short/long term relationship as an example), and simply because people don't spent a lot of time in music, doesn't mean others will not spent a lot for time other things, such as sports, so the inference that people didn't spent a lot of time on music therefore have a lot of more time for a relationship doesn't make sense).",

I just don't don't think this effect was considered salient and I would hazard it probably wasn't.",

        "comment": "Your expectation of a negative effect of charter schools just led me to do a quick Google Scholar search. The first hit for 'charter school meta analysis' was Betts and Tang 2016, and their abstract says \"A meta-analysis was performed of the literature on charter schools and achievement, with a focus on lottery-based studies and rigorous value-added studies. Overall, for the limited set of charter schools, locations, and years that have been studied to date, charter schools are producing higher achievement gains in math relative to traditional public schools in most grade groupings. No significant differences emerged for reading achievement. However, for both math and reading the bulk of estimates are positive. Estimated charter school effects are highly variable, which likely reflects variations in the quality of education provided both at charter schools and at comparison schools, namely, local traditional public schools.\"\n\nThus - variability, but higher math scores on average is a reasonable prior.\n\nBy the way, 0% probability of replication doesn't make sense given that they will be using a 'significance' threshold of 0.05 - so type I error should emerge 5% of the time.

If we were looking at the most ambitious female cohort we would have expected there to be even less of a difference in preferences that were privately or publicly assessed. If we looked at female graduate students in other disciplines the effect might actually be stronger, surely?",

The country may have helped them to get where they are, but there's a bias at play where they'd attribute their access to their own efforts etc. rather than external circumstances (and unfortunately they may also more likely blame the poor for their own circumstances - e.g., 'they're poor because they're lazy'). They are also more likely to identify with the 'rich group' than the nation overall because it affords them a higher status and greater self-esteem. ",

However, when asked unobtrusively, wealthy people appeared not to favor voting for illiterate people.\nThe unobtrusive questioning was done by presenting a list of four classes of people who might or might not be allowed to vote, 2 which were expected (by the author) to elicit affirmative votes from most people and 1 expected to receive a negative vote from most people, and one was the question about illiterate voting. Then, the survey recipient was asked just to state the number of categories (of the four) that should be allowed to vote.  There was a bit more to it than this, but in essence, if the subject said '2 of these categories of people should be allowed to vote', this was interpreted as a vote against illiterate voting, but if the subject said '3 of these categories of people should be allowed to vote', this was interpreted as a vote for voting rights for illiterate people.",

Also agreed that factors such as racial bias might influence trustworthiness ratings. However, in this instance, the authors chosen all Caucasian males, so while I think this lowers the generalizability, we can at least be sure that the groups were \"matched\" on race (and gender).",

Thanks for your comment :) I was unsure whether I got it right because I am unsure about the goal of that test - isn't it obvious that one would judge someone on a mugshot as less trustworthy than someone on a professional picture (even through demand effects)? Of course, you also need to test \"obvious\" effects empirically, but I am just baffled by why they would want to know this. It would make a bit more sense to me if they compared the mugshots with the professional pictures of the same people or make it less obvious that its mugshots.

They say that the desire to vote AGAINST an incumbent is one of the reasons they expect higher turnout when an incumbent is on the ballot. \nBy the way, if you are so skeptical, how do you justify your upper bound of 90% chance of replicating and your middle point as 50% chance? If you thought this claim was implausible, why do you think there is a good chance of it replicating?",

The T2 associations in Table 3 control for T1; they, thus, get at change in BMI over time. We wouldn't expect a cross-sectional association at baseline (which is what the claim is about - that higher N is associated with higher BMI concurrently) to also necessarily demonstrate a change-over-time effect. They don't report whether the cross-sectional association  is present in hierarchical regressions at T2 so we don't actually know if the significant correlation at T2 in Table 2 survives the control variables. My guess is it would; others may see it differently!",

I can think of several examples where it is likely to occur during particular periods; Palestinians in Israel, Nigerians or Chinese by some in Australia, middle-eastern countries during and since 9/11 in America, and so on. I don't know why the Swiss were against Yugoslavia around that time, specifically, but there's probably some historical 'reasoning' for it.\n",

Indeed,bivariate  analyses  found  that  employed  mothers,particularly  those  who  entered  employment  prior to their child\u2019s 9th month, had greater work history,more  education  and  skills,  and  lower  welfare  use than  their  peers  who  remained  out  of  the  labor market  or  who  entered  employment  later.  Mothers with early employment also had the highest family incomes (albeit still below the federal poverty line).The pattern of greater human capital among moth-ers  who  enter  employment  soon  after  child bearing replicates   results   from   other   economically   dis-advantaged  samples,  such  as  the  Fragile  Families and Child Well-Being Study (Berger et al., 2008), as well  as  from  more  advantaged  samples  (Brooks-Gunn  et al.,  2010).",
