I m a bit confused about why they did this   it s not a direct test of whether skill has changed  i e  demographics too   But sure  I think it would
probably replicate because of differences in all the things that they define in the skill vector

minimal  1 5 units   Although there might be an effect I think they are stretching their claim here  There is a difference between statistical and
scientific significance as well

I dont like that this study exists   This unfortunately seems plausible   working mums have less time to cook healthy meals and practice healthy
habits  Uses imputation to fill in missing data   always feels like a bit of a red flag   The distribution of the data in Table 1  and the fact that the
total number of hours you can work has an upper bound  makes me feel like it might have been appropriate to transform number of hours
worked rather than keeping it on a natural scale   Maternal characteristics include     is this a full list of variables  Probably not  the lack of
transparency here worries me  P value close to 0 05  I am suspicious of cherry picking and p hacking

While the underlying effect might be plausible  though with confounding of  developing linguistic norms over time    I m not sure this will replicate
mainly because there are no effect sizes  and the data is so large  The operational definition and measurement of some  like readability  is
questionable  though this is not my area   The other measures seems relatively more rigorous  So yes  it might replicate because databases might
be similar  but is it meaningful

Uncertain as I am not sure if the design makes it trivially more  replicable     physical activity was assessed through self report    If this was really
the main point of their study they would have had people be active in the lab  or followed them over a period of time  This seems both QRP y to
me  and bad measurement   small sample size      looking at figure 1  it seems like the entire effect is driven by there just being MAINLY physically
active people in the younger group

The operationalisation of this claim to  essentially  a difference in performance on a standardised test makes me very confident that a direct

The timing of the familiarity measure means that it was very likely influenced by the ease of doing the pitch matching task  making this
association almost tautological  I think   The effect size is so large that it s either an artifact  demand characteristic  etc   or a truly large effect

The heterogeneity in the cumulative adversity indices  sample sizes  demographics and covariates may mean that the results are only
generalisable to a specific cohort of people  The  use of a less conservative approach may mean a different result would have been found if a
different analysis had been conducted

based on translated works may not be similarly replicated in other countries  Higher bound   Ineligible candidates screened out at every stage
Statistical analysis seems robust at first look  However the extensiveness of results means that the higher bound is given based largely on

As discussed in the group  while there were a few questions including why didn t they prereg the study  was the effect size in fact large

This is likely to replicate given all the details provided in the report  and what I know of explicit instruction and teacher s developing design
knowledge  presuming that it translates to behavioural and cognitive change   The conditions of replication however  are hard to come by  so this
is where it may be an issue

While the researchers have found themselves a relatively ideal situation for this experimental design  relatively new school  have not yet invested
in significant professional development programs   this situation is very hard to come by in reality  I think    It s often difficult to get a control
condition like they have done here  Also  if we know that explicit instruction significantly  even if not statistically  improves student learning  it
becomes an ethical question to replicate this in future studies  potentially disadvantaging students in those in the control condition





16

ETS

15/08/2020 4:43 PM


Any kind of explicit training on teaching methods  relative to control  should affect teachers  approach to teaching  But I doubt to what extent
that will transfer to students  performance  It might depend on a range of  factors  such as the length of the program  the teachers  way of
teaching before such training etc

causal

I still don t understand if the study is related to  Chinese Canadian fathers  or  Chinese Canadian parents    If it is based on fathers  then findings
can t be generalised to both parents  I think  1  Were the tools questionnaires standardized  reliability statistics are not sufficient to say that a
certain assessment measure is valid standardized  2  Were the tools culturally and linguistically valid   Considering the parents migrated from
China to Canada  were familiar with English  still  the tools should be culturally sensitive   3   The data should have been reported on the duration
of migration to see if this duration influenced variable 4   Children of various age groups should have been recruited to have age wise differences
in opinions  if there were any   5  In my opinion  a 5 point Likert scale is not a good option to collect responses   perhaps 7 or 11 point likert scale 6

If we do the same analysis in the same country with the same results there is a 60  chance that we ll get the same result  However  the
communication and the channels can change from time to time so it is really important to know what are we replicating  Exactly the same thing
or a similar situation  Exactly the same thing would result in similar values as its a computerized analysis  I also believe that if you replicate this
study in another country both the claim and the probability of getting the same results would change

REASONS AGAINST  Many statistical tests conducted  no correction for multiple comparisons  as far as I can tell    12  of participants excluded
Participants completed  items from the AMS  not the whole measure  REASONS FOR  High prior probability  plausibility   strong manipulation of

Plausible that people are likely to behave in a way that increases their social standing when this decision is public  Small p value  Gender

have likely to make

Group exclusions are high  which might indicate poor ppt understanding or study instructions  However  the effect size and direction reported in
experiment 3 is not inconsistent with those reported in exps 1 and 2  which  might  indicate effect consistency across task types  One red flag in
particular is that experiment 3  but not experiments 1 or 2  uniquely employed a priming manipulation to  boost the power of the manipulation
by enhancing perceived public scrutiny  see  Digiteyez pp 662     given that the main effect being reported is an interaction between prestige
orientation and decision transparenct  directly manipulating decision transparency via priming in experiment 3 already invalidates the paper s
collective  meta analysis  of the three experiments due to methodological inconsistency

High correlation between dominance and prestige  Uncertainty whether the task and measures capture the claim fully





131

GK

13/08/2020 4:51 PM


The prestige measure might not be very good   Participants might not be very motivated to care  which would make it harder to find an effect
The fact that they added something to the manipulation  compared to experiments 1 and 2  suggests that maybe they had a file drawered version
of experiment 3 where they didn t get the effect  unlikely but possible

Likely to replicate  Seems to make sense at face value  but I m not sure if things like gender differences might make the effect less stable if the
sample had a different ratio of men to women  Also the  the study was conducted online where the notions of public and private might not be as
strongly felt compared to an in person  offline study

It is a small sample pilot study that shows promising trends in the expected direction  The authors argue that a higher powered study is required
to confirm the findings  I agree  p  001  I am not sure how to interpret the effect size  but it seems large given the lack of compliance  The t tests in
this study also do not consider baseline values  Different baseline values that aren t accounted for could influence the result in a potential
replication

When worry is not a significant mediator  it is probable that a similar construct  vulnerability  is not a strong mediator  too  Moreover  those
groups were not similar in terms of other variables  As it is reflected in the abstract   Compared with women in the control group  those in the
intervention group had higher perceptions of vulnerability  worry  and intention to stop smoking

other effects I am less certain about

While the underlying effect might be plausible  though with confounding of  developing linguistic norms over time    I m not sure this will replicate
mainly because there are no effect sizes  and the data is so large  The operational definition and measurement of some  like readability  is
questionable  though this is not my area   The other measures seems relatively more rigorous  So yes  it might replicate because databases might
be similar  but is it meaningful

Including all covariates and then choosing which ones to eliminate based on the results is a recipe for producing false positives  by over fitting
However  the effect is very intuitive and both variables are measured with self reports  so I think it will replicate    The only twist is that we re
predicting the results of a multiple regression so the other variables in the model could mess things up

Eliminating p  2 is likely to decrease probability of replication as when including other variables  some variance for this effect will be lost  But this
still seems like a likely effect due to overlap between externalising and sexual activity

Done over a number of days with varying groups so I think that will help it replicate  sample size also quite large and low P value  However

may be different

with a direct replication  controlling for same variables in similar population  might get similar results  but if it s a  true  effect would expect it to
be present in the white sample  Suspect there s an unmeasured confounding variable  like noise pollution being stratified by race   and or it s not
a true relationship

It would be super hard to replicate this in today s online environment  These days it s all about targeted marketing via social media   this seems so
old school as to be almost comical  No p values are reported  so it s hard to judge the effect  but the b coefficient is small  The t value does
suggest that the p would be low  though

I m not sure why the results were almost entirely reported for male and female students separately  only the fifth hypothesis used the full sample
It appears that the control for scholastic achievement was only used for the fifth hypothesis  This is probably my own ignorance  but I m not sure
that SEM was needed in this study at all given it does not appear to be multi level research  All of this makes me wonder why the authors went
about the analysis in the way they did

I relied heavily on my distrust of the data  how it was analysed and reported  to give this a low probability of reproducibility  However

it s something you would assume would replicate but would you be able to replicate the exact results from this particular study  ie pathway
analyses would require larger sample sizes than what is there  Also were people disappointed that they smelled cinnabun but ate cookies  would
that affect their willingness to buy the product

It seems like the underlying premise is plausible  and a bit intuitively obvious  as most of these variables would likely be at least moderately
correlated  therefore likely to be replicated  I m not familiar with the reported stats format so can t comment on that aspect of the study

meta analyses show that intention is linked with physical activity behaviour  however despite attempts to get a representative sample  the

opinion about the replicability of this study





659

GK

13/08/2020 4:51 PM


I don t fully understand the claim  but as I understand it it seems very unlikely   seems like they were looking for something else which didn t work
out but as they also collected information on attitudes and found something significant they went with that   With the exception of 48 home
based interviews ofcontrols  who were excluded from the current analysis     this is clearly part of a much larger study  a planned side aspect at
best and p hacking harking at worst  especially as they re not referring to another study where those 48 were used       why did they exclude
participants with existing heart problems  surely those should also count towards confirm their result if this is real     Fifty four of the 737 control
respondents with evidence of preexisting CHD  based on a 12 lead electrocardiogram and self report of Rose angina and previous coronary events
were ex cluded from the analysis








660

I am not sure if this was the cause but rather that there were a lot of reasons for CHD in the life of these people in a very stressful time  What
exactly was the  attitude score   which they refer to at the title as one variable  It is more a bunch of variables

The correlation coefficient for explicit and attitude was similar to implicit and attitude  both close to  27   So  the predictor strength of implicit
believability is replicable  but its relative strength compared to explicit one is less probable to be replicated

The relationship here makes intuitive sense so the results do not appear to be surprising and have face validity  However  the methods used are
not psychometrically valid   Likert scales are categorical and have been treated as continuous  So  it is difficult to know whether a study conducted

Any kind of explicit training on teaching methods  relative to control  should affect teachers  approach to teaching  But I doubt to what extent
that will transfer to students  performance  It might depend on a range of  factors  such as the length of the program  the teachers  way of
teaching before such training etc

The claim is plausible given what we know about considerations of harm in western cultures  The physiological arousal might be linked to

From 1 3 2  Emotional inhibition seems to be equated with physiological arousal  which I m not sure is appropriate  I m also not entirely sure
about the causal relationship between physiological arousal and the outcomes  There are lots of alternative explanations  But  I see no reason
why higher arousal should not in the future be correlated with these outcomes  the problem is more conceptual

problems with this study  I think the sampling strategy  chruchgoing partents versus sports club  ambiguiety about the extent of naturalisation

I received some information about the type of experiment they were conducting  which highlighted a few important things  My initial take on the
statistics wasn t necessarily correct   the sample size is actually low  the interaction test is  fragile   there is no way to interpret whether the effect
size is reasonable or not  and the clustering of the SE isn t great   Also  there was suspicion there was some QRP s going on  However  I still left my
upper bound quite high  because the effect of variation on performance kind of seems reasonable

replication was conducted in a similar ish  context  this should find an effect in the same direction

They have been translated to a new language where they haven t been validated but I think that s unlikely to be problematic  It s possible that the

Mainly  this paper presented many different possible factors that influence their model  These sorts of models are difficult to assess because I m
unsure about whether their assumptions about the model are correct or biased  did they include a lot of stuff because it accounted for variation
that might go against the effect they predicted    Their findings to make sense  though  and the direction of their interactions are what I would
assume to be correct

I think the claim itself is pretty plausible  and I can see a causal pathway between SUN and an increase in the use of health services  however  the
paper also notes that there are many potentially mediating factors that I think would also cloud replications

mainly because there are no effect sizes  and the data is so large  The operational definition and measurement of some  like readability  is

I am mainly influenced by the underlying plausibility of this claim   I think it is the case that private school students are more likely than public
school students to enrol at any postsecondary institution  even when student background details are taken into account  Further  I see no reason
why HSIs would be particularly different from this trend  The sample size of students and schools makes me think that this finding is likely to be
robust  although  it is highly dependent on the particular context of US high schools and post sec institutions

The claim that friendship and resource allocation preferences in children are guided solely by accent seems implausible  many other potential
predictors and confounds which are impossible to control for  Moderate p value given decent sample size

Effect widened to account for plausibility of effect  but doubts remain about mechanism behind effect  I find it more plausible after group
discussion that the effect might be  non zero  as one group member put it  but still think it would be vastly difficult to control for potential
confounds

relationship to involvement in decision making and school improvement activities  However  I suspect there s an underlying factor here they re

Seemed politically motivated  Small effects  P  05   But also very plausible that these would be correlated  That there s some causation   I don t
know     This is one where I can understand they d be correlated but I think it s more likely that there s a third variable influencing both  like the
cool guy said for the last one  And if that s what the replication tested   just the basic correlation  then sure  I guess it might replicate  But I don t
think we know if the causal claim is supported in this and I don t know how likely it is

Lower bound  I still don t understand and couldn t figure out the methods  The hypothesis is shaky  there are complex interactions in the model
and a bunch of other predictors  I don t know what else is changing over this time period  Also  effect size is small   Suspect QRP s are at play here
Upper bound   you could get the data and find something significant here  and the claim sounds kind of plausible  Sample size is large

a health marker getting better  which is harder to envisage than it not changing at all

marker we re assessing here then I can see it being possible  Still think it s more likely to find no difference than an improvement

Including all covariates and then choosing which ones to eliminate based on the results is a recipe for producing false positives  by over fitting
However  the effect is very intuitive and both variables are measured with self reports  so I think it will replicate    The only twist is that we re
predicting the results of a multiple regression so the other variables in the model could mess things up

Eliminating p  2 is likely to decrease probability of replication as when including other variables  some variance for this effect will be lost  But this
still seems like a likely effect due to overlap between externalising and sexual activity

quality measures     Low replication likelihood    BUT  the test is only about the relationship in african americans  so its not super implausible that a
relationship exists  Also  Fully adjusted Race stratified  just means  two logistic regressions with covariates       So good for them  that describes
normal analyses  just done twice

The study comes from a strong Indigenous epistemology positioning   the theoretical work is strongly positioned with the Indigenous ways of
being and knowing  which gives me a stronger confidence in replicability  However  my conception of what constitutes replicability is not the
same as what it was for the previous cases as this is the first one where  1  the findings are qualitative    2   direct  replications will be challenging

The sample size is huge  359 092 observations   Assuming the same technique is used to measure standard errors  it should not be hard to get a
significant effect  And it is well known that wages are larger for larger firms  It seems reasonable that wages would increase more on the high end
of the wage scale  increasing the white collar blue collar wage gap  Thus a pretty small difference between low and high estimates

I think that it is plausible that organisations with better protected employees are more profitable but I m not sure if that could be tested this way
as I would think the social desirability of a self report would be so strong as to override any real effect  Therefore both effect and replicability
should occur but not necessarily be linked because of social desirability

Lower bound has moved slightly down  Still  I believe the authors tried hard to compensate for many potential confounds  and the premise that
pop music should be  mostly  similar to be successful makes sense  that s why it s pop music   I also feel that though the group felt there could be
come confounds to the way they quantified similarity  I think that the authors attempted to be methodical about their approach  and had a large
amount of data to support the distribution of similarity between pop songs that they predicted

Seems to provide counter evidence for a claim we looked at earlier  if doctors are leaving when the economy is doing poorly how could mortality
rate decline  Looks like they only looked at migration out  and only out to specific locations eg the US  but not migration into countries  Why not
look at changes in the absolute number of doctors    or compare rates of people arriving and leaving

Despite the medium coefficient  the finding seems intuitive  They also controlled many variables that can bias the relationship  So  although the p

The timing of the familiarity measure means that it was very likely influenced by the ease of doing the pitch matching task  making this

I don t fully understand the claim  but as I understand it it seems very unlikely   seems like they were looking for something else which didn t work
out but as they also collected information on attitudes and found something significant they went with that   With the exception of 48 home
based interviews ofcontrols  who were excluded from the current analysis     this is clearly part of a much larger study  a planned side aspect at
best and p hacking harking at worst  especially as they re not referring to another study where those 48 were used       why did they exclude
participants with existing heart problems  surely those should also count towards confirm their result if this is real     Fifty four of the 737 control
respondents with evidence of preexisting CHD  based on a 12 lead electrocardiogram and self report of Rose angina and previous coronary events
were ex cluded from the analysis

distance from the  main language  of the country  Also  India rolled in with African countries  But the inferential results seems broadly replicable

There is a question about the language that is taught in the schools   for the 11 African countries this appears to be English  but the analysis
relates to the official State language and the local dialect  The relationship between the variables feels convoluted

The claim is plausible given what we know about considerations of harm in western cultures  The physiological arousal might be linked to
behavioral inhibition activation as a result of goal conflicts  The problem is the composition of the sample and the reliance on one measure of

Group exclusions are high  which might indicate poor ppt understanding or study instructions  However  the effect size and direction reported in
experiment 3 is not inconsistent with those reported in exps 1 and 2  which  might  indicate effect consistency across task types  One red flag in
particular is that experiment 3  but not experiments 1 or 2  uniquely employed a priming manipulation to  boost the power of the manipulation
by enhancing perceived public scrutiny  see  Digiteyez pp 662     given that the main effect being reported is an interaction between prestige
orientation and decision transparenct  directly manipulating decision transparency via priming in experiment 3 already invalidates the paper s
collective  meta analysis  of the three experiments due to methodological inconsistency

The claim is that hospitals that are  corporatized   that is  run more like corporations without being privatized  become more efficient over time  I
am not at all an expert in the type of data analysis used  and it s a long and complex paper with lots of tables  so my confidence is not high  What
on earth is  genetic matching   Also  this would be very hard to replicate as it relies on a very specific environment  the German hospital system





122

CN

15/08/2020 1:19 PM


Different hospitals in different areas would react differently to privitisation  They bring up the point that political aims would impact efficiency so
if there s a stable political party then efficiency may be high as they re used to working that way  also hospitals switching between corporation
run and not were excluded which would ve been an interesting result

Uncertain as I am not sure if the design makes it trivially more  replicable     physical activity was assessed through self report    If this was really
the main point of their study they would have had people be active in the lab  or followed them over a period of time  This seems both QRP y to
me  and bad measurement   small sample size      looking at figure 1  it seems like the entire effect is driven by there just being MAINLY physically
active people in the younger group

The PD tells teachers what they are supposed to learn and they probably pick up on that in the post intervention interviews  so replication is

The study may be highly replicable but my sense is that the design is very flawed  They are teaching the teachers to notice things and then they
show them videos and of course the teachers will notice what the PD intended them to  Teachers are good learners  Dodgy design  in my view

Eliminating p  2 is likely to decrease probability of replication as when including other variables  some variance for this effect will be lost  But this

If you tried to replicate this  it is highly dependent on the variability in the teacher  control  and the quality or engagement of the treatment  Also
I assume there would be lots of differences between those treatment groups  Might explain  moderate  effect size

I think that it is plausible that organisations with better protected employees are more profitable but I m not sure if that could be tested this way
as I would think the social desirability of a self report would be so strong as to override any real effect  Therefore both effect and replicability
should occur but not necessarily be linked because of social desirability
