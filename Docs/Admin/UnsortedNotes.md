## 20201021 repliCATS Phase2 Planning Meeting 
Two main changes (a) single trace claims ~1000-1500; multiple trace claims/networks of claims for the rest
and (b) not just replicability but a whole suite of ‘credibility signals’

### Credibility Signals
#### Generalizable 
Original claim supported across diverse samples, treatments, outcomes, and settings
https://docs.google.com/document/d/12rv_4_zKN535gTyYwxro0Y36hgZNW5TIx7mF_5lhxYs/edit  
#### Replicable
Original claim supported with independent evidence
#### Robust (stastically)
Original claim supported with diverse treatments of original data

#### Reproducible: Outcome
Original claim supported with same analysis of original data
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Em17UeJoVsNLvOu41rN1rvD6KR6iVpxSSBxtXErPrAc/edit  
#### Reproducible: Process
Possible to assess outcome reproducibility of original claim

#### Internally consistent
Reporting of original claim does not have detectable errors

## 20201016 RAT check-in 
### Phase 2 Roles 
-	Team Lead (Martin)

maybe publication tracking.
o	Elicitation responsibilities – oversee collection of textual data and involve RAT analysts as required.   
o	Supervise qualitative and mixed methods analysts and contribute to the data-management decisions and 
qualitative analysis processes.
o	Supervise research assistants
o	Reports to DARPA. 
o	Research contributions  
-	Qualitative Research Fellow (Eden)
o	Qual-methods admin: e.g., documentation related to the codebook-development and qualitative analysis 
decisions and practices.
o	Core qualitative analysis responsibilities: data-analysis decisions related to human-interpretation 
textual-analysis practices
o	Support elicitation practices & mixed-method analysis - as required.  
o	Conceptual analysis – (tbc). 
o	Research contributions 
-	Mixed-methods(?) Research Fellow (New Person). 
o	Data-pipeline admin: management of textual-data pipeline and software-tools   
o	Core mixed-methods analysis responsibilities: data-analysis decisions related to automated textual 
analysis practices   
o	Support qualitative analyst – contributing to manual data-analysis practices and data-analysis decisions 
related to human-interpretation practices. 
o	Support elicitation practices – as required. 
o	Research contributions
-	Research Assistants 
o	Contribute to data-analysis processes as required. 
### Phase 2 planning
-	Known things: 
o	Refine elicitation questions (expand)
o	Refine codebook (reduce – and tailor for new elicitation questions). 
o	Existing papers – continue 
-	Yet to be decided things: 
o	Any new paper plans?
o	Qual-specific research questions?   
o	Aggregation methods – are we committed to reasonWAgg?
