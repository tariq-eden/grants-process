## 20201119 RAT Meeting 
### Phase one wrap up? 
Stuck. Not urgent. Need to get the anonymised data from David before we can set up the example NVivo project and related data-extracted examples 
Next steps for known outcome claims? 
another round for coding? Timing/budget - would need to be in the new year. Might not be worth it? Document the limitation instead and go with what we’ve got. 
### Bushel claims: 
Bushel 8-10 questions for overall paper - Samine has drafted questions which we need to go through and refine response scales etc., 
Also, questions at level 3 and 4 similar to phase 1 - for replicability plus a question on relevance of level 3 or 4 claim to the overall paper. 
Pilot at AIMOS 2020 (using phase 1 claims from one paper).
Pick a short paper  
What do we want for text for reasons? Separate out text-boxes for ReasonWAgg and use tag-clouds as a filter for what text we analyse for reasonWagg - and for qualitative reasoning. 
Danger with tags that people use them even if they didn’t think about it in their reasoning 
Credibility question - 
Add triviality questions? Or is it included in the general validity? Include in the existing questions. 
Reasoning text: 
1 box for generalisability - with multiple y/n questions for specific dimensions.  
1 box for validity - with multiple scales for types of validity    
1 box for credibility  - force response 
Discussion: 
Tech limitations mean that threaded comments easily - need to decide if we want that.  
Asynch discussion 
Needs a longer window of time (toggle the close-claim function). 
workshort May/June (alongside SIPS) Nov/Dec (alongside AIMOS) + 1.
have participants do  a few single-claim assessments prior to doing the bushel claims. 
have an expert in groups as a draw-card
### Quick check in on RAT tasks - see Monday. 

## 20201028
ICR 0.60 - nine out of the 25 reasonWAgg categories reach this
- Martin to send info to  update the documentation records.

Codebook:
- need to review the descriptions and refocus to capture the new elicitation question.
- Tagging - could this be used to calculate reasonWAgg?
- Need to user-test the platform, including those features that have a material impact on the interpretation

Freetext discussion (rather than commenting on justifications)
- still need to keep the justifications attached to questions viewable in the platform.
- Fallon is going to hunt down examples of what this would look like and circulate.
Github repository
- set up and ready to be given to the repliCATS group.

New-person: waiting to hear back from David; position description still in progress;
- need to be able to do the mixed methods analysis

Known-outcome claims:
- Updated in the google drives. Need to be merged (Eden) and case classifications (Andy) need to be done then ICR (Martin).

COVID claims:
- waiting on source files

Ethics (UniMelb)
- Eden to get a handover and do training on new system (Infonetica ERM), then revisit the  original application and update with Phase 2 info (check amendments). Related chat in #research_ethics slack channel.


## 20201021 repliCATS Phase2 Planning Meeting
Two main changes (a) single trace claims ~1000-1500; multiple trace claims/networks of claims for the rest
and (b) not just replicability but a whole suite of ‘credibility signals’

### Credibility Signals
#### Generalizable
Original claim supported across diverse samples, treatments, outcomes, and settings
https://docs.google.com/document/d/12rv_4_zKN535gTyYwxro0Y36hgZNW5TIx7mF_5lhxYs/edit
#### Replicable
Original claim supported with independent evidence
#### Robust (stastically)
Original claim supported with diverse treatments of original data
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Em17UeJoVsNLvOu41rN1rvD6KR6iVpxSSBxtXErPrAc/edit
#### Reproducible: Outcome
Original claim supported with same analysis of original data
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Em17UeJoVsNLvOu41rN1rvD6KR6iVpxSSBxtXErPrAc/edit
#### Reproducible: Process
Possible to assess outcome reproducibility of original claim
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Em17UeJoVsNLvOu41rN1rvD6KR6iVpxSSBxtXErPrAc/edit
#### Internally consistent
Reporting of original claim does not have detectable errors
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zIi7tO07s0E1gZI4KBHHe3gzNDU3xqJcz5zkz7tFvYs/edit
#### Construct Validity
Did the study actually measure and/or manipulate the constructs that the authors wished to study
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1miWxYIS0tVTJ3mTCOLkVUG4Z5Ubke37wRqlH9NZDU3M/edit
#### Causal Inference Validity
Did if causal claims are made or implied, are they warranted?

## 20201016 RAT check-in
### Phase 2 Roles
-	Team Lead (Martin)
o	Team admin: meetings, how RAT fits into project (including liaising with other team leads),
maybe publication tracking.
o	Elicitation responsibilities – oversee collection of textual data and involve RAT analysts as required.
o	Supervise qualitative and mixed methods analysts and contribute to the data-management decisions and
qualitative analysis processes.
o	Supervise research assistants
o	Reports to DARPA.
o	Research contributions
-	Qualitative Research Fellow (Eden)
o	Qual-methods admin: e.g., documentation related to the codebook-development and qualitative analysis
decisions and practices.
o	Core qualitative analysis responsibilities: data-analysis decisions related to human-interpretation
textual-analysis practices
o	Support elicitation practices & mixed-method analysis - as required.
o	Conceptual analysis – (tbc).
o	Research contributions
-	Mixed-methods(?) Research Fellow (New Person).
o	Data-pipeline admin: management of textual-data pipeline and software-tools
o	Core mixed-methods analysis responsibilities: data-analysis decisions related to automated textual
analysis practices
o	Support qualitative analyst – contributing to manual data-analysis practices and data-analysis decisions
related to human-interpretation practices.
o	Support elicitation practices – as required.
o	Research contributions
-	Research Assistants
o	Contribute to data-analysis processes as required.
### Phase 2 planning
-	Known things:
o	Refine elicitation questions (expand)
o	Refine codebook (reduce – and tailor for new elicitation questions).
o	Existing papers – continue
-	Yet to be decided things:
o	Any new paper plans?
o	Qual-specific research questions?
o	Aggregation methods – are we committed to reasonWAgg?
