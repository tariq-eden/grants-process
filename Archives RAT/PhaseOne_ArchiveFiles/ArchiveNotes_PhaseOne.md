# Notes on the RAT Files Archived from Phase One (2019-2020)

## Items to archive:
- Final version of the codebook
- Final training material provided to naïve analysts (Version 10)
- Transcripts of interviews (anonymised)
- Interview guidelines
- Script for the ICR calculations? (Ask Steve)
- Anonymised versions of the raw platform data uploaded into NVivo (4 types)
- Anonymised versions of research-question query outputs
-	Sample NVivoproject - a de-identified sample of NVivo project for archiving and data transparency
(use AMIOS19 and AIMOS20 datasets that have been anonymised as per previous step).
-	Spreadsheets of actual data export from NVivo (for unique ids per row of data)
Eden to test what will work for that. Martin can organise case classifications to be done in ~ Nov if needed.
-	Methods Documentation - Eden to update/clean-up, Martin to review

## Questions to resolve:
- Check for responses involvement in paper and exclude that answer from the data set (to preserve anonymity)
- Check for responses that are inflammatory (has the potential to impact third party reputation),
including responses coded to ‘private knowledge’, and present to the broader team for discussion
about inclusion discussion for ways to de-anonymize (or exclude) prior to sharing data.
- Do we include a Private folder with the linked identification table with the Archive.
