## Questions to resolve:
- Check for responses involvement in paper and exclude that answer from the data set (to preserve anonymity)
- Check for responses that are inflammatory (has the potential to impact third party reputation),
including responses coded to ‘private knowledge’, and present to the broader team for discussion
about inclusion discussion for ways to de-anonymize (or exclude) prior to sharing data.
- Do we include a Private folder with the linked identification table with the Archive.
